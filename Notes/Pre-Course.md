# Pre-Course: Setting Up

Prior to the start of the course, I downloaded **R** and **RStudio** on my laptop. **R** can be installed on the computer in a super easy way, and the procedure of downloading is exactly the same for PCs (Windows) and MACs(MAC OS). 

## Downloading R

To download R, direct to the website [mirror website from Tsinghua University](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/CRAN/) or [mirror website from Iowa State University](https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/). Download the suitable version of R and install it following instructions.

## Downloading RStudio

To code using R, RStudio is the most widely-used IDE. Download the studio using this link [RStudio Download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Select the *RStudio Desktop* version, which is free to use. Download the suitable version and install it following instructions.

## Setting Up RStudio

After successful installation of the two above, we can open the RStudio and direct it to the  **Console**. We will add a useful package here. Write the following code

```R
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

After seeing a successful download, your R and RStudio are ready to be used.
