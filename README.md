# QTM 150 Data Science and R
This is my class notes on the course **QTM 150** at Emory University. The full name of this course is **Introduction to Statistics Computing I**. This course focuses on learning the basics of R and using R for data science. It is a sequence course at the Institutes of Quantitative Method and Theory; the sequent course is QTM 151, Introduction to Statistics Computing II, focusing on introducing Python and using Python for data analysis.  

## The course description: 
This course is an introduction to the R programming language. It will cover the programming basics of R: data types, controlling flow using loops/conditionals, and writing functions. In addition to these basics, this course will emphasize skills that are relevant for data analysis.
